## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I would like to create a social application that shares recommendations of books and movies within a known friends list. A user would sign up and log in with their unique credentials. The user can create a post by tagging movies and books they have gone through. Users should also be able to rate these titles on a five star rating scale. Friends of the user should be able to view these posts, and click a button to "agree" or "disagree" with the post. Being able to see what your friends have already watched or read, as well as their opinion on the title, may be of more value to the user than a review left by someone unknown to the user. This allows friends to share their interests easily. The application could allow the user to create a wishlist of titles to read or watch. Friends often talk about media they have watched or read on sites public to everyone, this is a platform mainly for posting about it within a group of known people whose opinions may matter to the user.  
### Features
User Login
User will be able to create an account and log in to the application. Creates a profile for user.

Create a Post
User will be able to create a new post when logged in to profile.

Tag a Post
User will be able to insert titles of collections through tags, generating a link to general information on the matter such as title, image, author/director, and synopsis.

Agree/Disagree with a Post
User will be able to visit friends' profiles to view posts and click button to "agree" or "disagree" with rating. 
### Technologies
Java
Thymeleaf
Spring Boot
HTML
CSS
MySQL
PHP
### What I'll Have to Learn
I do not really know anything about PHP (hypertext preprocessor) so I will have to learn that for the tags that will contain basic information on the titles in this application.
